### Current Status (Oct. 24th):
- Successfully logs in using OAuth 2.0 flow via a FitBit App
- Using the frontend, can select a number of days worth of foodlog data to fetch from the backend
- Correctly displays data in calendar heatmap library
- Correctly displays import and data options. Only the 'days back' option and 'refresh data' button are currently wired up
  
### Plan:
- Fully functional data and import options
- Calendar heatmap is optimally responsive to viewport size changes
- Data import selection is instantly reflected in the calendar heatmap without having to refresh data from backend
- Add responsive analytics table
- Data import selection is instantly reflected in the analytics table without having to refresh data from backend
